## Introduction

Researchers highlight the urgent need for improved heat illness prevention measures in the Korean army due to increasing temperatures linked to global warming and other environmental changes.<br>
<br>
To address this, we proposed a solution centered around providing objective data. By sending objective data to the command control center, heat illness-related incidents could be prevented in advance.<br>
<br>
As a result, we developed a watch capable of detecting safety information from soldiers and notifying both the soldiers and command control centers through a mobile app and website.<br>
